Hi All,

This is just to let you know of the first release of PyStocks which
currently claim to interfaces most options provided by Yahoo ! Finance's
stocks quote service and all options of it's chart service. It's intended to
be easy to use (easier than all existing interface to Yahoo ! Finance, as it
is).
